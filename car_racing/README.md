# CarRacing-v1 Environment

## Description
The easiest control task to learn from pixels - a top-down racing environment. The generated track is random every episode.

Some indicators are shown at the bottom of the window along with the state RGB buffer. From left to right: true speed, four ABS sensors, steering wheel position, and gyroscope.
